                    <h1>Football</h1>
                    <p> Football is the world’s most popular ball game in numbers of participants and spectators. <br>
                        Simple in its principal rules and essential equipment, the sport can be played almost anywhere, <br>
                        from official football playing fields (pitches) to gymnasiums, streets, school playgrounds, parks, or beaches. <br>
                        Football’s governing body, the Fédération Internationale de Football Association (FIFA), <br>
                        estimated that at the turn of the 21st century there were approximately 250 million football players <br>
                        and over 1.3 billion people “interested” in football; in 2010 a combined television audience of more than 26 billion watched <br>
                        football’s premier tournament, the quadrennial month-long World Cup finals.

                    <p> Football, also called association football or soccer, game in which two teams of 11 players, <br>
                        using any part of their bodies except their hands and arms, try to maneuver the ball into the opposing team’s goal. <br>
                        Only the goalkeeper is permitted to handle the ball and may do so only within the penalty area surrounding the goal. <br>
                        The team that scores more goals wins.

                    <p> By the early 20th century, football had spread across Europe, <br>
                        but it was in need of international organization. A solution was found in 1904, <br>
                        when representatives from the football associations of Belgium, <br>
                        Denmark, France, the Netherlands, Spain, Sweden, and Switzerland <br>
                        founded the Fédération Internationale de Football Association (FIFA). <br>
                        Although Englishman Daniel Woolfall was elected FIFA president in 1906 <br>
                        and all of the home nations (England, Scotland, Ireland, <br>
                        and Wales) were admitted as members by 1911, British football associations were disdainful of the new body.</p>
